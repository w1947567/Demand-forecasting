# Demand-forecasting 

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Demand forecasting is a cornerstone of every manufacturing firm. Its forecasts are essential part of financial and manufacturing planning as it provides estimation of demand forecast for company. Accurate and reliable forecasting results contribute to more efficient data – driven decisions for long term business strategies and optimise supply chain operations on a day-to-day case. In order to achieve accurate forecasting results, the development of precise and right forecasting model for specific business case is a key of reliable future projection.

This project utilises four different time series forecasting models Holt-Wintes, ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM to forecast future demand of project. The key focus of this study is to determine the optimal quantity of time series data needed for accurate and reliable forecasting results. 

AIM: 
critically analyze and compare the accuracy of statistical forecasting techniques and neural networks in times series forecasting of sales, with a focus on determining the optimal data quantity required for high–accuracy forecasting

OBJECTIVES:
1. To evaluate the accuracy of traditional forecasting models (Holt-Winters, ARIMA, SARIMA) with different
data volumes.
2. Identify the accuracy of LSTM forecasting and compare to statistical models results.
3. To analyze the impact of data volume on models’ accuracy and performance.
4. To identify the strengths and limitations of each forecasting method.

MODEL USED:
1. Holt-Winters: exponential smoothing model for time series data with seasonality and trend components
2. SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average): a statistical model designed to handle both seasonality and stationarity in time series data.
3. ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average): a widely-used automated model for forecasting stationary time series data.
4. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly effective for modeling sequential data and capturing long-term dependencies.

DATA:
The project utilizes companys sales data, which monhtly time series data representing monthly product sales. The data is not uploaded because of confidentiality agreement with the company. 

CONCLUSION:
This project provides valuable insights into the data requirements for accurate demand forecasting. By comparing traditional statistical models (Holt-Winters, ARIMA, SARIMA) with a deep learning-based model (LSTM), which helps to practitioners in selecting the appropriate forecasting technique for business specific domain.
